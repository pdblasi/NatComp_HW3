\section{Problem 1 (from slides)}
\textbf{
Modify the heat flow example to deal with insulated conditions on the top and bottom boundary. Insulation means zero flux or u[N][j] = u[N-1][j]. This implies that instead of fixed valued ghost points on the top and bottom, you modify the CA rule using the previous relation.

\section{Problem 2 (from slides)}
\textbf{
Reproduce patterns theta, lambda, mu, and alpha in the Gray-Scott Model CA. You don't need to follow their color scheme.
